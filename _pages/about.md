I am a PostDoctoral researcher in the group of Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience (TCN), within the Center for Brain and Computation (CBC) within the Department of Engineering of Information and Communication Technologies (ETIC), at the University Pompeu Fabra (UPF), in Barcelona. 

My research interests are to investigate the connections between the physiology of neural interactions and the computational rules involved with sensory information processing, transmission and storage towards the aim of achieving cognitive and behavioral goals. In particular, I aim to combine focal attentional selection of features in visual modality to associated spatial patterns of motor action planning in reward expectation, hence analyzing gaze patterns to dissect overt visual sampling for foveal processing enhancement from reward expectation from target motion direction.

Both for the interest in inspecting how does the brain achieve its outstanding functions, and for my deep passion for science and technological innovation, I have always tried to expand my professional profile by conducting scientific research at interdisciplinary level, interfacing technological challenges in acquiring and curate behavioral and neural data with theorethical data analysis and modelling of information transfer at the columnar microcircuits level.

Besides research life, I have plenty of hobbies, mostly going in one main direction which is outdoors. I enjoy swimming regularly and <i>need</i> to go for some hiking or climbing adventures from time to time. Also, I can enjoy gardening quite a lot. I have participated in climate justice movements and volunteered in periodic cleaning actions in naturalistic sites.
