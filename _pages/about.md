I am a PostDoctoral researcher in the group of Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience (<a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/tcn" target="_blank">TCN</a>), within the Center for Brain and Computation (<a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc" target="_blank">CBC</a>) within the Department of Engineering of Information and Communication Technologies (<a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/etic" target="_blanK">ETIC</a>), at the University Pompeu Fabra (UPF), in Barcelona. 

My research focuses on exploring the connections between neural physiology and the computational mechanisms involved in sensory information processing, transmission, and storage, to achieve cognitive and behavioral goals. Specifically, I aim to investigate the interplay between focal attentional selection of visual features and the spatial patterns associated with motor action planning in reward expectation. This involves analyzing gaze patterns to differentiate between overt visual sampling for enhanced foveal processing and reward expectation based on target motion direction.

Both for the interest in inspecting how does the brain achieve its outstanding functions, and for my deep passion for science and technological innovation, I have always tried to expand my professional profile by conducting scientific research at interdisciplinary level, interfacing technological challenges in acquiring and curate behavioral and neural data with theorethical data analysis and modelling of information transfer at the columnar microcircuits level.

Besides research life, I have plenty of hobbies, mostly going in one main direction which is outdoors. I enjoy swimming regularly and <i>need</i> to go for some hiking or climbing adventures from time to time. Also, I can enjoy gardening quite a lot. I have participated in climate justice movements and volunteered in periodic cleaning actions in naturalistic sites.
