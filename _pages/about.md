I am a PostDoctoral researcher in the group of Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience (TCN), within the Center for Brain and Computation (CBC) at the Department of Engineering of Informationand Communication Technologies (ETIC), at the University Pompeu Fabra (UPF). 

My personal interest is to investigate the connections between the physiology of neural interactions and the computational rules involved with sensory information processing, transmission and storage towards the aim of achieving cognitive and behavioral goals. Both for the interest in inspecting how does the brain achieve its outstanding functions, and for my personal deep passion for science and technological innovation, I intend to expand my professional profile by conducting scientific research at interdisciplinary level.
