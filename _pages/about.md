<p style="font-size:.75em">I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience (<a style="color:#444" href="https://www.upf.edu/web/tcn" target="_blank">TCN</a>) group at the Center for Brain and Computation (<a style="color:#444" href="https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc" target="_blank">CBC</a>) within the Department of Engineering of Information and Communication Technologies (<a style="color:#444" href="https://www.upf.edu/web/etic" target="_blanK">ETIC</a>), at the University Pompeu Fabra (<a style="color:#444" href="https://www.upf.edu/" target="_blanK">UPF</a>), in Barcelona. </p>

<p style="font-size:.75em">My research focuses on exploring the connections between neural physiology and the computational mechanisms involved in sensory information processing, transmission, and storage, to achieve cognitive and behavioral goals. Specifically, I aim to investigate the interplay between focal attentional selection of visual features and visuospatial patterns associated with motor action planning in reward expectation. This involves analyzing simultaneous eye tracking and neural data to investigate the interaction between overt visual sampling for enhanced foveal processing and reward expectation based on target motion direction.</p>

<p style="font-size:.75em">Both because of my interest in inspecting how the brain achieves its outstanding functions, and my deep passion for science and technological innovation, I have always tried to expand my professional profile by conducting scientific research at an interdisciplinary level. My work is located at the interface between technological challenges in the curation of experimental data and the theoretical modeling of information encoding and transfer at the columnar circuit level.</p>

<p style="font-size:.75em">Beyond my research pursuits, I have a passion for the outdoors. Whether it is swimming regularly, embarking on hiking or climbing adventures, or indulging in some therapeutic gardening, I thrive on connecting with nature. I am also committed to the environmental cause, having actively participated in divulgative discussions and volunteered in clean-up initiatives at natural sites.</p>
